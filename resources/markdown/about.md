# About Windowlight

<h2 class="subheading">What is Windowlight?</h2>

**[Windowlight](https://windowlight.desilva.se)** is a code screenshot generator that uses [Torchlight](https://torchlight.dev) for syntax highlighting.

## How does it work?

Windowlight wraps the Torchlight API, providing a user-friendly interface to generate beautiful code screenshots, fully online - right from your browser.

We call Torchlight from our server, and then we display the result in a beautiful, customizable code window, that you can then download as a high quality PNG image.

Using Torchlight means that you can use their special directives, allowing you to add code highlights and annotations, and even Git diffs to your screenshots.


## Why use Windowlight?

### Features include:

- Probably the best syntax highlighting available
- Customizable code window with support for file labels
- High quality PNG images with support for high resolutions
- Choose any background color, including transparent backgrounds
- Add annotations and highlights to your code, and even Git diffs
- Fully online and browser-based, no need to install anything
- [Open Source](https://github.com/caendesilva/Windowlight), and 100% free to use!

### Backed by the power of VS Code

Additionally, since Torchlight is powered by VS Code and TextMate, you get extremely accurate and feature rich syntax highlighting.
This includes support for virtually any programming language (over 100 languages supported, including PHP, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, C++, C#, Swift, Go, Rust, and many, many more)

## Terms and Conditions

### General Terms

To keep things nice and friendly for everyone, here is some stuff to keep in mind. I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. 
I created Windowlight because I wanted to use it myself, and I'm sharing it with you because I think you might find it useful too.
I'm acting in good faith and ask that you do as well.

### Usage Limits

To prevent abuse and excessive load on both my server and the Torchlight API, there are some very generous rate limits of **30 requests per minute** or **1000 requests per day**, whichever comes first.
