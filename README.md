### Information

This app is built with Laravel, TailwindCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

While open source, it's not designed to be self-hosted, and no support will be provided for that.
Breaking changes may occur at any time without notice. Contributions however, are very much welcome!

Also note that large parts of the app is quickly bodged together, and is not necessarily pretty or well-designed.

Thanks to [Torchlight](https://torchlight.dev/) for making this possible!
