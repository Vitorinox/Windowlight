## Windowlight's August Update: Leveling Up Your Code Screenshot Experience

I'm thrilled to announce the August update for **[Windowlight](https://windowlight.desilva.se)**! This release brings a host of new features and improvements, further enhancing your code screenshot generation experience.

### What's New in Windowlight?

#### 1. Smart Code Indentation

One of the standout features in this update is the new **smart code indentation** functionality. Now, you can easily format your code directly in the Windowlight UI:

- Use **Tab** to indent selected code blocks
- Use **Shift + Tab** to deindent selected code blocks
- Configurable tab size (default is 4 spaces)

This feature allows for quick and easy code formatting, ensuring your screenshots always look polished and professional. Perfect for when you paste in an indented function or snippet that you want to align with the window.
